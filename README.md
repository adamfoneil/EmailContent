MVC and Razor Page content is great for viewing in a browser, but what about for sending as email? Rendering MVC views and pages to strings variables for sending as email has never been very straightforward, as far as I can tell. I've done a couple of solutions over the years that were really app-specific. There are libraries for this like [RazorLight](https://github.com/toddams/RazorLight), and what looks like a great solution from [Rick Strahl](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Jun/21/Back-to-Basics-Rendering-Razor-Views-to-String-in-ASPNET-Core#how-to-capture-razor-output). There are lot of articles on this online if you go searching -- lots of one-off solutions and StackOverflow answers. You too may have been tempted to implement your own Razor substitute or templating mechanism at some point.

I wanted to take a swing at this that let me use Razor pages in email that were easy to preview in the browser, yet would work seamlessly as email content. This means being able to render view content to a string variable as well as have some kind of security. Since my solution uses an `HttpClient` that is not authenticated, this Razor page email content usually needs to prevent direct viewing in a browser by end users. (For example, welcome emails for new user registrations that might contain passwords.)
